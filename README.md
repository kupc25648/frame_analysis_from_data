# frame_analysis_from_data
FEM analysis of frame structure that read structural data stored in .txt file

What the project does?

This is the Program to calculate 3D Frame Structure using Matrix Analysis Method. By reading .txt that contain stuctural data including loads, nodes, and elements. The program will form the structure stiffness matrix and will calculate deformations of the structure and strain energy. It also have export module which will export structure in .obj format. 

How users can get started with the project?

The repository includes 3 parts

FEM_frame.py
frame_GEN.py
frame_example.py
Users can create define source of frame structures, loads and restrains in "frame_example.py".
Users can create define using guideline in 'data_source/source_example_format.txt'
